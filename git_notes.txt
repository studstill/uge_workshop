This is the new file that I created.  I'm still pretty dang confused

Here are the most recent notes that I added to my notes file.

HEAD, and master - are labels
master - is a branch; which is made automatically

git branch - tells you which branch is the active one
git brance [NEW BANCH] - creates
git checkout [Branch] - switches to a new active branch (or label)

touch  - Creates a new file

also, the "dot" in the tab in Sublime means that the file has not yet been saved.

I am changing this to see what happens

This again is me changing notes...
